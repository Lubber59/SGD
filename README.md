# SGD
This is a project that I made during my first year of master, in collaboration with a classmate and under the supervision of a teacher-researcher of my college. We studied the article "stochastic learning" of LÃ©on Bottou. We implemented Kmeans and perceptron algorithms in order to test and evaluate the stochastic gradient descent compared to the "classical" gradient descent.
